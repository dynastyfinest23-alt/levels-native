# Action items for Noah

## M2.4 full-flow artifact — screenshot path unavailable (2026-07-15)

PRD M2.4 status now cites the M-DS.3 reveal-flow screenshot set as its
full-flow artifact, but `Screenshots/` at the repo root is currently
empty/absent (per CLAUDE.md, that folder is transient and only present when
populated). Did not re-shoot per Task 2c instructions — flagging instead.

If you want a durable artifact on record for this gate, either point to
where the M-DS.3 screenshots actually live now, or ask for a fresh screenshot
pass next session.

## Resolved — love_flow decision (2026-07-16)

**Decision: defer — keep `love_flow` = 530.** Noah reviewed the 530-vs-550
brief and chose to hold off recalibrating; the book's citation for 550 is
adjacent (a "Love of 550..." quote, not a dedicated anchor heading like the
other 11 tokens), and a change buys no behavioral difference in the common
full-`love_flow` case. No scoring artifact touched — `answer_to_raw_score`,
`scoring.dart`, golden tests, and CLAUDE.md's scoring table all remain as
deployed/verified 2026-07-15. Removed from the open list; no further action
needed unless Noah revisits the citation later.
